This folder contains scripts used for developing more functionality.
- `instance_segmentation.py` to develop further (automatic) instance segmentation methods
- `tracking.py` to develop further tracking functionality

Note that the scripts here may change quite fast and might not yield good results or not work at all because the corresponding functionality is still under development.
For how to run the napari annotation apps that implement the more stable and tested functionality check out the [examples](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam/tree/master/examples)

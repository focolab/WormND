## WormID: A Benchmark for 3D Neuron Detection, Identification and Tracking in Worms


C. elegans presents a simple and effective model system for understanding basic questions in systems neuroscience, which are fundamental to unlocking transformative translational clinical innovations. In order to analyze neural activity data in C. elegans, the existing protocol commences by capturing the 3D NeuroPAL fluorescence map comprising three channels for neuron identification and recording a 3D calcium image video in grayscale for neuron activity extraction. Neurons from both modalities are later matched to aggregate the information. Given the expansive scale and diversity of the acquired data, manual neuron annotation proves to be a resource-intensive process, and the currently available computational approaches lack the requisite robustness.

In response to this challenge, we have curated publicly available annotated data from five distinct laboratories and established systematic benchmarks, effectively breaking down the overarching objective into two discrete tasks, involving 108 and 60 annotated volumes respectively. Through our preliminary analysis, it became evident that the existing computational methods exhibit considerable room for enhancement. Consequently, we envision that our WormID challenge will serve as a catalyst for engaging a broad audience specializing in image analysis, with the ultimate aim of fostering the development of more resilient and sophisticated methodologies.
